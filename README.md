# AOC2020

## Notes

- Day 1: figuring out IO was fun 😂
- Day 2: learning about records would make this more readable
- Day 3: so happy to use pattern matching again ☺️
- Day 4: TIL importing stuff, TIL `Maybe T`
- Day 5: Straighforward. I feel like how my expressions are written could be really improved. Args separated by spaces but without surrounding `()` like in Lisp feels really weird.
- Day 6: part1 was extremely easy, just use a Set. part2 was equally simple, excepted the input contained a `\n` at the end wich messed up with the result.
- Day 7: phew, learning about custom data types at the same time wasn't a fun exercise. Ended rewriting everything with maps and a simpler data structure and it's way much simpler to read.
